# spotifyStage2


The app has full functional Create, Read, Update and Delete.  However, I was not able to get the components to render upon making change to database.  Changes are reflected on the backend but may need to refresh the window for changes on the frontend to appear.

For rendering the calendar, a seed script file was created to seed the database and render each month on the frontend. Please make sure to run the 'npm run seed' command to fully seed the database with the calendar so it can be rendered on the front end.
